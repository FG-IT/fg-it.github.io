# Core Points

## The Four Things To Avoid When Fighting
1. Criticism (批评)
2. Contempt (鄙视)
3. Defensiveness (防御)
4. Stonewalling (阻挠)

## Planning For Disagreements

### Divide and Conquer. 
Everybody has a responsibility in a field. Decide ownership. Usually, CEO has final say. Board has real final say.
  
### Know yourself.
**Attachment Style**
1. Secure
2. Anxious
3. Avoidant

[What Is Your Attachment Style?
 from The Scholl of Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2s9ACDMcpjA)

Know your own and your cofounder's attachment style.

Document a process. While you're emotionally sober, create a process for dealing with disagreements. [Decision Disagreement Framework - How we encourage disagreements at Matter](https://matterapp.com/blog/decision-disagreement-framework-how-we-encourage-disagreements-at-matter)

### Use Non Violent Communication

"When **\[observation\]**, I feel **\[emotion\]** because I'm needing some **\[universal needs\]**. Would you be able to **\[request\]**?"

#### Obversation vs Evaluation
Obversation: you'd send that document last week and I haven't received it
Evaluation: You're lazy

Obversation: three of the numbers in this report were inaccurate
Evaluation: Your work is sloppy

Obversation: you arrived 10 minutes late to the meeting this morning
Evaluation: you ignored me

#### Emotions vs Thoughts
I feel scared **vs** I feel blamed.
I feel resentful **vs** I feel judged.

[Evaluative words](https://en.nvcwiki.com/index.php/Evaluative_words)

#### Universal Needs
* Autonomy
* Collaboration
* Respect
* Reassurance
* Security
* Support
* ...

#### What is Violent Communication? 

If “violent” means acting in ways that result in hurt or harm, then much of how we communicate—judging others, bullying, having racial bias, blaming, finger pointing, discriminating, speaking without listening, criticizing others or ourselves, name-calling, reacting when angry, using political rhetoric, being defensive or judging who’s “good/bad” or what’s “right/wrong” with people—could indeed be called “violent communication.”

#### What is Nonviolent Communication? 

**Nonviolent Communication is the integration of four things:**
* Consciousness: a set of principles that support living a life of compassion, collaboration, courage, and authenticity
* Language: understanding how words contribute to connection or distance
* Communication: knowing how to ask for what we want, how to hear others even in disagreement, and how to move toward solutions that work for all
* Means of influence: sharing “power with others” rather than using “power over others”

**Nonviolent Communication serves our desire to do three things:**
* Increase our ability to live with choice, meaning, and connection
* Connect empathically with self and others to have more satisfying relationships
* Sharing of resources so everyone is able to benefit


### Pay Down your emotional debt
Pay this down every day

**3 level conversations**
1. informal conversation
2. some emotional, talk about some things that are personal
3. relational, something that's happening right now between two people that is super, super important. Find the root.

## Summary
* Everyone fights, so make a plan
* Figure out roles, goals and a process before emotions get involved
* Start having hard conversations now
* User non violent communication to share honest feedback without criticism
* Pay down emotional debt regularly.
