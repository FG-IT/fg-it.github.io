# 16 Factors Makes People Feel Reluctant to Start Startups

1. **Too young** 
   
   Startups need adult founders. 'Adult' is not defined by age, but behavior. 

   One test: whether you still have the kid flake reflex. Resillient, Responsible, How to react to challenges.

2. **Too inexperienced**
   
   > There's no better time to take risks than when you're young. Sure, you'll probably fail. But even failure will get you to the ultimate goal faster than getting a job.

3. **Not determined enough**
   
   Of course, successfully startup need determined founder. However, the question is we often underestimate our determination. Larry and Sergey themselves were unsure at first about starting a company.

   Test: whether you're sufficiently driven to work on your own projects

4. **Not smart enough**
   
   Starting a startup just doesn't require too much intelligence. Do startup whose decisive factor is effort, not brains. 

5. **Know nothing about business**
   
   >  The initial focus should be the product. All you need to know in this phase is how to build things people want. If you succeed, you'll have to think about how to make money from it. But this is so easy you can pick it up on the fly.

6. **No cofounder**
   
   A real problem. A startup is too much for one person to bear. 


7. **No idea**
   
   No idea is not even a problem. Founders are more important than the initial idea. The main thing YC cares about is whether you're good at making things

   Recipe for getting startup ideas: Find something that's missing in your own life and supply that need.  


8. **No room for more startups**
   
   This is false. Nearly everyone who works is satisfying some kind of need. 

9.  **Family to support**
    
    This one is real. So start startups when you're young.

10. **Independently wealthy**
    
    Startup founders will endure lots of schleps. If wealthy is not the motivation, what else could be?

11. **Not ready for commitment**
    
    A startup doesn't take longer commitment than a regular job. 

12. **Need for structure**
    
    In the early time of a startup, each person should just do what they need to without anyone telling them. Founders should be independent-minded.

13. **Fear of uncertainty**
    
    > if you start a startup, it will probably fail. Seriously, though, this is not a bad way to think about the whole experience. Hope for the best, but expect the worst. In the worst case, it will at least be interesting. In the best case you might get rich.

14. **Don't realize what you're avoiding**
    
    Regular jobs suck! You are forced to work on tasks that you have no interest in. This is what you can avoid when you start a startup.

15. **Parents want you to be a doctor**
    
     > So I think the way to deal with your parents' opinions about what you should do is to treat them like feature requests. Even if your only goal is to please them, the way to do that is not simply to give them what they ask for. Instead think about why they're asking for something, and see if there's a better way to give them what they need.

16. **A job is the default**
    
    > It's exciting to think we may be on the cusp of another shift like the one from farming to manufacturing

    > There have only been a handful of these great economic shifts in human history
